## Introduction
AppGallery Connect Cloud Storage is scalable and maintenance-free. It allows you to store high volumes of data such as images, audios, and videos generated by your users securely and economically. The service can free you from development, deployment, O&M, and capacity expansion of storage servers, so you can focus on service capability building and operations with better user experience.

Xcode 11.0 or later
iOS 9 or later
